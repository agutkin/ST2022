# Mockingbird System N1-b

System `N1` provides the results for all five data partitions. The suffix `b`
corresponds to the number of training steps: 35,000.

Cognate Neighbors model, where a single model is constructed for each language
in a language group
([implementation](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/cognate_inpaint_neighbors)).

Note: The training set of language groups does *not* have results for the
`listsamplesize` set.
