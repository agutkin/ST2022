# Mockingbird System I1

System `I1` provides the results for all five data partitions. The final result `i1/surprise/${LG}/${PART}` is generated by the ensemble of 10 individual systems under `i1/surprise/bantubvd/${PART}/_${N}/`, where `${LG}` is the language group, `${PART}` the partition and `${N}` is an integer from 1 to 10.
